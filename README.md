This case study repository includes an R script including two functions to retrieve and visualise GBIF occurrences of a predefined species within Belgium. 
Next there is an R script running these functions for the region of Flanders and the Asian hornet *Vespa Velutina* as the species of interest. 
Parallel with the latter the repository holds an RMarkdown script, that generates an html guidance document for potential users.
